// This is challenge work for the "C# Players Guide"
// Level 16 Simula's Test Challenge
// The goal is to use enumeration for the state of a chest
//The chest has four three states OPEN <> CLOSED <> LOCKED
//The user can do the following actions (in lowercase) OPEN > close > CLOSED, OPEN < open < CLOSED, CLOSED > locked > LOCKED, CLOSED < unlocked < LOCKED

// Set up
ChestState Chest = ChestState.LOCKED;

//Provides status and captures user's input
//Convert to lower to capture user input errors on word
//Other input errors will be handled by StateChange method
